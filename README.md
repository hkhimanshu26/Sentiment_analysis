Dataset Used
- IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews (CSV format)
  { It is a very large file, so i tried to convert this csv file to pdf file as it becomes very small in size to upload}
- Columns: 'review' (text), 'sentiment' (positive/negative)
- 80% training and 20% testing split

Random Forest Model is a very large file, so i split that file into 8 file.
